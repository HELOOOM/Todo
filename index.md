# ToDo Application using containers

BY : Lakhmiri / Sakassa / Benzemroun

## Introduction
### **TODO** List are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day to day tasks or list of everything that we have to do. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks any time and delete a task which is completed. The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:

1. Add tasks
2. Update tasks
3. Read tasks
4. Delete tasks


## First let's describe our application

1. A menu bar containing : "File , Options , Help"
   - file menu containing : "New , Exit"
     - <span style="color:red">**_New_**</span> is an action which can add a new task to our application
